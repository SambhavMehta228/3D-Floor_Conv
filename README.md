# Convert 3D Images to Floor Plans

This Python script converts 3D images into floor plans using advanced preprocessing techniques and object detection with Mask R-CNN.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- TensorFlow
- Keras

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

pip install opencv-python numpy tensorflow keras
## Usage

1. Download the Mask R-CNN model file (`mask_rcnn_coco.h5`) or train your own model.
2. Save the model file in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script from the command line, providing the input and output image paths:

python convert_3d_to_floor_plan.py <input_image_path> <output_image_path>

Replace `<input_image_path>` with the path to your 3D image and `<output_image_path>` with the desired path for the generated floor plan image.
## Notes

- Ensure the Mask R-CNN model file is named `mask_rcnn_coco.h5`.
- The script assumes the input image is a 3D image that needs to be converted into a floor plan.
- For best results, use high-quality 3D images.
- This is a basic implementation. For better accuracy, consider training a custom Mask R-CNN model on your specific dataset.
